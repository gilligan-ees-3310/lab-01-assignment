The file `Lab_01_Activities.Rmd` is a template for the exercises in Lab #1 to use
RMarkdown to do the following exercises from Chapter 2 in the textbook 
_Global Warming: Understanding the Forecast_.

The lab is due by 11:59 pm on Thursday Jan. 16.

The file contains exercises 2.1--2.7.

The answers to exercise 2.1 are given as an example of how to include
answers in RMarkdown.

* Graduate students should answer all of the exercises. 
* Undergraduates should try to answer exercises 2.2, 2.4, 2.5, and 2.7.

For the first week of lab, full credit will be given for trying this, even 
if you can't get it to work or if you get the wrong answers.

## Instructions:

* Accept the assignment in GitHub Classroom.
* On your web browser, go to the repository for the assignment.
* In RStudio, create a new project, choose "Version Control". Then choose 
  "Git" and paste the URL for your assignment repository.
* In your RStudio project, use the template "`lab-01-activities.Rmd`" and 
  fill in text and R code to answer the questions. 
  There is a worked example to help you understand what you need to do.
* When you are done, knit your `.Rmd` file into a PDF file or a Word (.docx)
  file.
* Use git to commit your changes (including the edits to `lab-01-activities.Rmd`
  and the new `.pdf` or `.docx` file) to your local git repository.
  You can do this from the "Git" tab in RStudio.
* Push the changes from your local git repository to GitHub. You can do this 
  using the "Pusl" button (the blue up arrow) in the "Git" tab in RStudio.
* When you are finished with the lab, or have gotten as far as you can go,
  go to the Brightspace discussion board and post a comment about your
  experience using these tools (R, RStudio, and Git) to do these exercises.
  
  Comment about what was clear, what was unclear or difficult, and any ideas 
  you have about what would make it easier to do these kinds of labs in the 
  future.

As you work on these projects, I advise using git to commit changes frequently 
as you work and push those commits to GitHub.
