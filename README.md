The file `lab-01-report.Rmd` is a template for the exercises in Lab #1 to use
RMarkdown.

The lab is due by 11:59 pm on Wednesday, Feb. 3. 
**For this first lab assignment**, you will get full credit will be given for 
trying, even if your R code doesn't work or if you get the answers wrong. 

**Starting next week**, labs will also be graded for correctness and for 
effective use of RMarkdown in writing up and explaining your answers.

In the report, I give a worked example as a model of how to answer problems
using RMarkdown.

There are three exercises for undergraduates and four for graduate students.

## Instructions:

* Accept the assignment in GitHub Classroom.
* On your web browser, go to the repository for the assignment.
* In RStudio, create a new project, choose "Version Control". Then choose 
  "Git" and paste the URL for your assignment repository.
* In your RStudio project, use the template "`lab-01-activities.Rmd`" and 
  fill in text and R code to answer the questions. 
  There is a worked example to help you understand what you need to do.
* When you are done, knit your `.Rmd` file into a `.pdf` file or a 
  Word (`.docx`) file.
* Use git to commit your changes (including the edits to `lab-01-activities.Rmd`
  and the new `.pdf` or `.docx` file) to your local git repository.
  You can do this from the "Git" tab in RStudio.
* Push the changes from your local git repository to GitHub. You can do this 
  using the "Push" button (the green up arrow) in the "Git" tab in RStudio.
* When you are finished with the lab, or have gotten as far as you can go,
  go to the Brightspace discussion board and post a comment about your
  experience using these tools (R, RStudio, and Git) to do these exercises.
  
  Comment about what was clear, what was unclear or difficult, and any ideas 
  you have about what would make it easier to do these kinds of labs in the 
  future.

As you work on these projects, I advise using git to commit changes frequently 
as you work and push those commits to GitHub.
